# SlideProUnlock
The original ccrama/Haptic-Apps Slide application has Pro features. One of the
features is the ability to backup and restore settings. This is an issue with
my, edgan, fork of Slide. My apks have a different signing key. Which means you
need to backup your settings before you uninstall the original Slide. The
unlock is controlled by a package named
`me.ccrama.slideforreddittabletuiunlock`. It is as simple as that. This simply
gives you a placeholder apk by the same name to unlock the Pro features.
